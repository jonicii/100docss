        CSS is an awesome tool, but definitely takes some time to learn.
        One great thing about learning CSS and HTML is that you see immediate
        results from your learnings, which is very motivating. I think everyone
        should give this a shot!

      I'm starting to get the hang of this! This page is starting to look pretty
      good, and I think I'm understanding more about the layout of CSS and html.
      I still got a long way to go, but I will not stop until I am the best
      front-end developer in the world!
